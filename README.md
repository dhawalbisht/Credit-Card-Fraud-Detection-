Our Credit Card Fraud Detection project successfully addressed the pressing need for an intelligent and scalable solution to combat electronic transaction fraud. Leveraging TensorFlow, Seaborn, and Python prediction libraries, we achieved significant milestones in enhancing fraud detection systems' accuracy, adaptability, and real-time capabilities. Utilizing TensorFlow enabled the creation of a robust deep learning model capable of autonomously learning intricate patterns indicative of fraudulent transactions. Seaborn integration facilitated comprehensive exploratory data analysis, providing valuable insights into transaction patterns, outliers, and key features influencing fraud detection. Our systematic workflow, from data preprocessing to real-time prediction, showcased an effective approach to developing and deploying a fraud detection system. Incorporating diverse Python prediction libraries, including Scikit-learn and XGBoost, contributed to model evaluation, fine-tuning, and prediction accuracy.
